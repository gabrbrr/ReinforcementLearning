# ReinforcementLearning
Project repository for the Reinforcement Learning course at Sapienza University of Rome. The project consists of an implementation of the XGNN paper (Explanation of graph-neural network predictions at model-level) by using Proximal Policy Optimization instead of a vanilla policy gradient method.
